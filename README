This project provides solution to Programming Exercises given in C++ Primer Plus (Developer's Library), 6th Edition, by Stephane Prata.

The include/ folder contains the Header files necessary to build the solutions.
The src/ folder contains the C++ solutions.

Steps to Build
--------------
1.  Run the configure script
    > ./configure

3.  Run Make
    > make

All the object files (*.o) and executables (*.out) would be generated in the src/<chapter_**> folder.
Change the working directory to src/<chapter_**> and you could run the individual solutions.
